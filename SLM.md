you heard that right. Many people still use LLMs even for small tasks like summarization, classification, or email replies. But LLMs are expensive, and using them for everything often wastes their full potential. üßê 

Instead, try using SLMs (Small Language Models). They‚Äôre free, open-source, can run locally, and work really well for basic tasks. 

In one of my recent projects, the task was simple I just need to generate a respond email to a customer email. Initially, we used LLMs through Hugging Face inference APIs and Groq. But those came with limits on free usage. So we decided to shift to open-source models running locally. That‚Äôs when I realized we didn‚Äôt need a huge model at all. For such a simple task, a small model was more than enough.

Here are some of the SLMs I tried and personally found useful :
1. Llama3.2-1B (works great) 
2. Qwen2.5 1.5B Instruct
3. TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
4. SmolLM2 1.7B
