As AI Agents become more powerful, one challenge remains:

How do they talk to each other, securely and efficiently, across frameworks and vendors?

Thatâ€™s where AI Agent Protocols come inâ€”think of them as the HTTP of the Agent world.

Let me break down 6 groundbreaking protocols shaping the future of Agentic Interoperability: 

ðŸ“Œ MCP (Model Context Protocol) â€“ Anthropic
- Enables secure two-way communication between an LLM and external tools.
- Think of it as the USB-C for AI agents connecting to real-time data.



ðŸ“Œ A2A (Agent 2 Agent Protocol) â€“ Google
- Built for agent-to-agent communication, regardless of vendor or framework.
- Enables agents to discover, collaborate, and execute multi-step tasks.



ðŸ“ŒACP (Agent Communication Protocol) â€“ IBM
- A RESTful protocol enabling persistent, secure agent conversations.
- Focused on asynchronous, scalable, and observable execution.



ðŸ“Œ AGP (Agent Gateway Protocol) â€“ Cisco
- Supports streaming, pub/sub, and real-time routing via gRPC.
- Perfect for high-speed, event-driven, multi-agent environments.



ðŸ“Œ ANP (Agent Network Protocol) â€“ ANP Team
- Built on W3C DIDs + JSON-LD for decentralized interoperability.
- Ideal for agent discovery and negotiation across domains.



ðŸ“Œ Agora â€“ University of Oxford
- Transforms natural language into protocols dynamically.
- A game-changer for user-centric multi-agent workflows.
