MoE Architecture is now empowering your powerful AI Agent models

Let's break down why LMs like Gemini 2.5 are using this approach...

Gemini 2.5, Llama 4 to Deepseek R1, here's how MoE works...

Within one year, we've seen a tremendous growth in LLMs built with a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture.

Open-source models that want to perform better at very low compute are utilizing this architecture.

Specifically, DeepSeek R1 is achieving performance comparable to OpenAI o1 while using only about 1/20th of the compute resources.

Similarly, Gemini 2.5 flash models use MoE to become faster and cost-efficient.

But why are companies adopting MoE,

Let's understand together through a comparison:

ðŸ“Œ Common components

- Input: The starting point for processing data/prompt/token.
- Normalization: Standardizes the data for consistent processing.
- Multi-head Attention: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
- Normalization: Further standardizes the data after attention.
- Output: The final processed result.

ðŸ“Œ Dense transformer Architecture:

- Operation: After the attention mechanism (which allows tokens to interact), the feed-forward network processes each token position independently

ðŸ“Œ Mixture of Experts (MoE):

- Operation: Different parts of the input are processed by different experts. For example, the noun "dogs" is processed by the Noun Expert, the verb "run" by the Verb Expert, and so on. Only the relevant experts are active for a given input.

- Experts are Specialized components that handle specific types of data or tasks. For example, in Llama 4 Scout, there are 16 different experts, and for Mavrick, there are 128 Experts each for a specific prompt.

ðŸ“Œ The real difference:

- Dense: Each token uses all feedforward parameters
- MoE: Each token uses only a subset of parameters (the selected experts)

ðŸ“Œ Here's why MoE Matters:

1. Efficiency: Only relevant experts activate for a given prompt, saving the much-needed computational resources.

2. Specialization: Experts handle specific tasks, improving accuracy per output.

Hence, if you are building AI Agents that deliver accurate performance by only utilizing a fraction of computational resources, MoE Models are your best Bet.
